# Hash Salt Helper

This module provide a more easily way to get the `hash_salt` for your Drupal8 site.

## Overview

Drupal8 require `hash_salt` in settings.php.
However, this value is not included in the backup generated by Pantheon.
To get the hash_salt of a site running on the Patheon, we have to use the [terminus](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus), but this is hard way for non-developers.

By using this module,  you can restore your site from the pantheon to local environment without CLI.
